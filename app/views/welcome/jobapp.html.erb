		<p class="noindent"> Hi future employers! </p>
		<p>My name is Yuchen Zhou and I am graduating with a Ph.D in Computer Engineering (research focusing on web application and third-party service security and privacy) from University of Virginia in May 2015.  You can find my Resume, research statement, LinkedIn and Github profile by clicking on the icons above. I am interested in both research-oriented industry lab positions and general software engineering/development positions. </p>
		<p><b>Research/Security Engineer Positions: </b> I do not have any specific preferences on research positions, as long as they are related to my Ph.D research areas - security and privacy. The particular domain that I know the best is web application and RESTful/Single Sign-On API security (please check out my <%= link_to "research projects page", research_path %>!).  I am also familiar with most basic concepts of lower-level vulnerabilities and defenses (e.g. buffer overflow, ROP), network security and a little bit about cryptography, and I am always super excited to learn more stuffs that I don't already know yet!</p>
		<p><b>General Industry/Developer Positions: </b> For general software development positions, I prefer to work on web application-related areas.  Throughout the years of my Ph.D studies, I have accumulated lots of hands-on experience with JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.  I have done works to <%= link_to "understand", research_fireinspector_path %> and <%= link_to "restrict", research_esorics_path %> third-party JavaScript behavior, and used Ruby to automate evaluation of my research tools in multiple projects.  I have also developed a small <%= link_to "Rails site", "https://www.github.com/Treeeater/Rails_MTG" %> to facilitate drafting for a trading card game as my hobby.  I will be very happy to work as a "full stack" engineer.  I am also open to general back end development involving C/C++, as I modified both Google's Chromium open source browser and Mozilla's Firefox browser as part of my Ph.D research, and they both are written largely in C/C++.
		<p> If you are interested in me, don't hesitate to <%= link_to "reach out", contact_path%>! </p>
		<p> Best, </p>
